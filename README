Ncnibbles is a 2 player snake game for the terminal. It uses Ncurses.

Play with the cursor keys and W-A-S-D. Press ESC to quit.

Compile with "g++ -o ncnibbles *.cpp -lncurses" or use qmake.
I've created this peace of software using Qt Creator but without 
using Qt libraries. It only requires C++ STL and ncurses.
